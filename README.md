# magento2-opensearch-dashboards

OpenSearch Dashboards with security plugin disabled for use in local projects.

# Docker Hub

Pushed to Docker Hub as [wwright/opensearch-dashboards-no-security:2.12.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/wwright/opensearch-dashboards-no-security)

## Notes

I tried many different ways to get opensearch and dashboards running locally in docker on HTTPS. There were
just too many issues with certificates and SSL and I couldn't get it to work. This image is a workaround
to easily get up and running.
